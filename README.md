# Simple Python Calculator 🧮

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

A lightweight Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input numbers. Perfect for beginners learning Python! 

---

## Features ✨
- ➕ **Addition**: `num1 + num2`
- ➖ **Subtraction**: `num1 - num2`
- ✖️ **Multiplication**: `num1 * num2`
- ➗ **Division**: `num1 / num2` (with decimal support)
- 🎯 **User-friendly**: Input validation for numbers (float-compatible)
- 📊 **Clean output**: Formatted results with emojis!

---

## How to Run 🚀

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Python 3.8+ installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git
   cd python-calculator
   python calculator.py
   ```
   *(or just download the `calculator.py` file and run it directly)*

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   ```
   Enter the first number: 10
   Enter the second number: 5
   ```

4. **See the results**:
   ```
   Results of your two numbers:
   Sum: 15.0
   Difference: 5.0
   Product: 50.0
   Quotient: 2.0
   ```

---

## Known Issues ⚠️
- ❌ **No division-by-zero handling** (will crash if `num2 = 0`).
- ❌ **No input validation** (non-number inputs will raise errors).

---

## Future Improvements 🔧
- ✅ Add error handling (e.g., zero division, invalid inputs).
- ✅ Extend operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).
- ✅ Loop for continuous calculations.
- ✅ Build a GUI version (Tkinter/PyQt).
